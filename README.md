# LICCF :church:

A repository used for the Lethbridge College VARchitects team

## Description

LICCF, which stands for Lethbridge Inclusive Catholic Fellowship, is a website design project that aims to create an intuitive, user-friendly online platform for a church community of the same name. The project involves creating a public-facing website that serves as an online hub for the church, providing information about the fellowship, its mission and values, as well as details about upcoming events and programs.

The LICCF website will feature a clean and modern design that is easy to navigate, with an intuitive menu and clear calls to action. The website's homepage will be designed to provide an overview of the church's activities and make it easy for visitors to find the information they need.

One of the core features of the LICCF website will be its member management functionality. This will allow church leaders to keep track of member information, including contact details, attendance records, and participation in various programs and activities. The system will also enable members to update their own information and communicate with one another through the platform.

Another important feature of the LICCF website is its donation tracking system. This will allow church leaders to monitor donations and manage financial records in a secure and efficient way. The system will also allow members to make donations online through e-transfer, either as one-time gifts or recurring contributions, and will provide them with a convenient way to track their giving history.

In addition to these core features, the LICCF website will include a variety of other tools and resources designed to enhance the church community's online experience. This may include an event calendar, sermon archives and other features to help foster community engagement and interaction.

Overall, the LICCF website design project is focused on creating an engaging, interactive online platform that meets the unique needs of a growing church community. By combining user-friendly design, robust functionality, and secure data management, the project aims to help the church thrive and grow in the digital age.
