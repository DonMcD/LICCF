  Centrally located, the Theatre Gallery site is barrier free and spacious. To protect those who are immune 
  comprised we ask that you wear a mask. We celebrate with chairs in a circular arrangement to emphasize 
  equality of all. The liturgical prayers and readings are in inclusive language and often representative of 
  contemporary spiritual writers. Readings are guided by the Comprehensive Catholic Lectionary 
  (Womenâ€™s Ordination Conference) and the Christian scripture is often read from the First Nations Version of
  the New Testament translation. We prepare both wheat and gluten-free breads for consecration. Come sing
   with live musicians. Come celebrate as one body. All are welcome at the table of thanksgiving.
